# Philosophers

In this program i learned the concept of multithreading and how to solve the "philosophers problem", we are required to create a program which take four prameters (Number of philosophers, how long they sleep in milliseconds, how long they eat in ms and how long they think in ms) and a fifth optional paramter (how many times will they eat). In this program i need to manage the shared resources and synchronize the time of the philosophers using mutexs

usage: `make & run the binary the required parameters`
